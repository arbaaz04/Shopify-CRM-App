## 💻 Technical Implementation Details

### **Backend Architecture**
```typescript
// Example: Order Processing Action
export const run = async ({ params, api, logger }) => {
  // Validate order eligibility
  const order = await api.shopifyOrder.findFirst({
    filter: { id: { equals: params.orderId } }
  });
  
  // Standardize shipping address
  const standardizedCity = await api.standardizeMoroccanCity({
    city: order.shippingAddress.city
  });
  
  // Process courier fulfillment
  const fulfillmentResult = await processCourierOrder(order, params.courier);
  
  // Update Google Sheets
  await api.writeBatchOrdersToSheets({
    orders: [{ ...order, trackingNumber: fulfillmentResult.trackingNumber }]
  });
};
```

### **Frontend Components**
- **React Hooks**: Custom hooks for state management and API integration
- **Shopify Polaris**: Consistent UI/UX following Shopify design standards
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live order status updates
